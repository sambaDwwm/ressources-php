a) unzip the files to a folder (for example c:\calendar)
b) Go to your Web server (php/mysql) and run the phpmyadmin
c) Create a mysql database worldcalendar , username root , password root (you can setup anything)
d) Go on phpmyadmin and import the database.sql file at the created database

The file include\dbcommon.php hat the settings

$host="localhost";
$user="root";
$pwd="root";
$port="";
$sys_dbname="worldcalendar";

You have to set it up, depents of your php/mysql server.
(If you follow exaclty step A,B,C , D and mysql server is the same as Mysql then you dont have to change settings)

E) copy(Ftp) whole folder (c:\calendar) to your ftp server
F) You are ready!

There is a user:admin , password:admin  , so you can use that or you can register a new one on login page
Hope to find it usefull
