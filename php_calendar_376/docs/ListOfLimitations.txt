ApPHP has some restrictions on it's use. 

[#001] [Limitation] 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Description: 
    ApPHP Calendar may work with different time blocks: 15 min, 30 min, 45 min or 60 min.
    But if you work with some time block and then try to change it, you need to
    take into account, that some events may disappear. It happens, when you increase
    time block size. For example, you started to work with 15 min. time block and then
    moved to 60 min. Event occurrences, that where placed on 15 and 45 minutes will
    disappear with new configuration.
Solution:
    Re-define events occurrences for new configuration.
